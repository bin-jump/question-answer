The question is kind-of like \"What\'s the difference between time-boxing and Scrum?\".</p><p>You\'ll hear DevOps called a \'culture\', a \'movement\', a \'methodology\', and all kinds of things that won\'t box it in well enough for you to understand it, even though those descriptions are accurate.  In a nutshell, DevOps is about the confluence of Agile methodologies, automation, and virtualization that enables a new feedback loop in the management/control/steering of a software project.</p><p>With aggressive automation, things that use to take a long time and be subject to human error now happen quickly and without incident.  As a result, we tend to do them more often.  A primary example of this is a \'deploy into production\'.  We used to save large batches of work and deploy them off-hours just in case \'something went wrong\'.  But now we can deploy changes several times a day, in a way that the chances of \'something going wrong\' is dramatically reduced, and in a way that the impact of something going wrong is much smaller when it does occur.</p><p>Once we have this repeatable process in place, we begin to see it as a \'pipeline\'.  Requirements go in, code deployed into production comes out.  We automate everything along this pipeline - tests, documentation, merges, deploys, and more tests, and so on...  Because people focus on the automation, they don\'t see the \'pipeline mentality\' that drove it.  <strong>This</strong> is the management methodology - the attention paid on the pipeline - that makes DevOps more than Automation.</p><p>Once we have that automation in place, the feedback loops kick in.  We start to measure things like <strong>cycle time</strong> so we can figure out things we had previous tried to guess with estimates.  Things about the architecture that make automation/continuous delivery hard tend to be replaced with alternative architectural patterns that make automation/continuous delivery easier (several great examples of this are documented in the book \'Evolutionary Databases\'.  \'Green/Blue Deployments\' are another).  </p><p>Notice I was able to provide this description without talking about Jenkins, Check, Puppet, Ansible, Vagrant, AWS, or any of the other tooling that supports it.  This is what we mean by the larger level buzzwords like \'methodology\'.  In the end, any set of tools can be replaced... What we\'re left with is the core management principles enabled by automation and the focus on the pipeline.</p>',3172,'2020-08-25 23:21:42',0,0,4),(3380,3,3302,'<p>A big part of DevOps is making it possible to release very often. That comes with automated build, automated testing, etc. You can say that to achieve its goals, DevOps need to use automation to be efficient.</p><p>Here\'s how DevOps and automation are related. DevOps is not just automation, there\'s more to it. Conversely, automation is not exclusively used by \"DevOps people\". A lot of automation was taking place in IT before DevOps came around.</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/m0tMY.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/m0tMY.jpg\" alt=\"DevOps in relation to automation\"></a></p><p>Please don\'t consider to above diagram to represent all that is DevOps, or all this is automation.

The idea is that rather than having departmental \'silos\' you can work directly with other teams to get things done quicker and more efficiently.</p><p>It\'s all about removing constraints and streamlining processes. Automation comes into this heavily because having repeatable processes helps remove constraints. For example: if someone from ops has to do a manual release process to get code out to an environment, there\'s a couple of things that can get in the way - one is that there has to be someone in ops free to do the deploy, and two, there is less confidence in the release process because manual work is error-prone. </p>',3180,'2020-08-25 23:21:43',0,0,0),(3384,1,3319,'<p>IMHO it doesn\'t <em>need</em> to.</p><p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DevOps</a> (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote>  <p>DevOps (a clipped compound of \"software DEVelopment\" and \"information  technology OPerationS\") is a term used to refer to a set of practices  that emphasize the collaboration and communication of both software  developers and information technology (IT) professionals while  automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure  changes.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>[2] It aims at establishing a culture and environment where  building, testing, and releasing software <strong>can happen</strong> rapidly,  frequently, and more reliably.</p></blockquote><p>I highlighted <code>can happen</code> as it is not <code>must happen</code>.</p><p>Nothing in the above description actually <strong>requires</strong> an agile development methodology. </p><p>But I suspect often transitions towards DevOps often incorporate insertion of agile methodologies in the development process as they really fit well together.</p>',3161,'2020-08-25 23:21:43',0,0,0),(3386,1,3319,'<p>At the Agile 2008 conference, Andrew Clay Shafer and Patrick Debois <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#Etymology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">discussed</a> \"Agile Infrastructure\".

The value of automation increases in direct proportion to the frequency with which Development creates new releases.  Frequent deployment has a positive impact on certain types of products, specifically consumer applications.  High velocity all the way through the software delivery lifecycle returns value for each iteration (anyone seen the CA ad where the zombies want new features in their apps?)</p><p>Without Agile, high-frequency releases are extremely difficult, if not impossible.  If the Development team is releasing software once a quarter, or twice a year, DevOps can still automate the process, but then what is the point?  The investment in time, training, and resources to adopt DevOps may be partly returned in quality, however, the best value is in maintaining high velocity throughout the delivery lifecycle.</p><p>One could also argue that if you\'re going to adopt DevOps, why <em>wouldn\'t</em> you also adopt Agile?  The principles that make them both work, work well together.  Practicing DevOps by itself, without Agile, could create an imbalance between Ops and Dev, in which Ops is outperforming Dev for service delivery.</p>',3163,'2020-08-25 23:21:44',0,0,0),(3392,9,3302,'<p>Automation and DevOps are unrelated.  DevOps is more like combined engineering where the Developers of a site or service are all the Operators of that site or service.  Why is this novel?

Because all the Ops team did was monitor and keep a list of dev phone numbers to call.</p><p>Notice I\'ve said nothing about automation.</p><p>Automation is about repeating success.  If I do steps a,b and c and process X always works, then steps a, b and c are good candidates for automation.  Then I can use the time for what used to be a manual process to do things that make me more money.  Automation is successful when it\'s simple.  Deploying new releases, running integration tests, torquing a nut on a bolt, backing up data, balancing credits vs. debits, etc. are all great candidates for automation because the steps are repeated whether by a person or a robot.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: What is new is that Developers are also the operators. There is not another group. Cooperation in my case was rare. If there was nothing in the Troubleshooting Guide (aka TSG) then you were guaranteed a phone call.

Like I said, small changes are important to avoid backlash. Integrating work for devs beyond standard hours will be challenging, as they may know they can look elsewhere for employment if they don\'t like it since the market for devs is strong right now, especially if they already had devops skills.

I\'m talking years long, none of this \"stand up a team for 3 months then stand them down\" business.</p></li><li><p>over the course of a project the release train will inevitably amass more people as more of both new project requirements based on newly realised business opportunities as well as the ongoing tax of maintenance style work.</p></li><li><p>I almost always see the trains run their first increment as 100% project/change teams, 2nd increment they allocate a percentage of time to Run work. 3rd increment management realise they are about to have a problem and starting adding teams to try and handle the Run overflow to give their now seasoned developers and engineers time to keep working on new requirements.</p></li><li><p>if the right balance is struck of project teams being able to keep delivering project outcomes without being bogged down to much in maintenance work and new teams who join the train aren\'t immediately expected to just be 100% support teams, but instead take on a fair portion of the change work that was going to be handled then you end up with delivery teams who are owning the products they are building by default, it doesn\'t need to come at them all at once that now they are a Run team, instead it just slowly integrates into their day to day activities.</p></li></ul><p>Where this model obviously has some weaknesses is in the pricing for a business. Generally I\'d expect to be paying a lot more for a change resource than a run resource, usually run contracts with major vendors are fixed price and the intent is that they make their money on continuous improvement and therefore cost savings.</p><p>That being said, it isn\'t all that difficult to consider the change teams stood up as part of a release train to simply be delivering continuous improvements.

At this stage you want to turn to the Google model, where every team has to operationalize their software, but not necessarily operate it. They will operate it at the start, but a big part of building software is to reduce the cost of operating it to a point, where the load is small enough that the operations team can sign on running it. Only then it is considered done.</p></li><li><p>Large enterprise with multiple business units, (where each has its own operations team): At this stage you can turn back to the Amazon model, where every team essential develops and operates their own services.

The idea behind such integration being \"<em>Consider our DB2 DBA-team (doing stuff with DDLs) as a special case of a development team, accidentally using some exotic editor (the BMC tool) to produce the code (DDL) to be migrated</em>\".</p><p>About the only (but <em>real</em>!) challenge about this integration was to also facilitate \"restartability\", which is one of the key benefits of such DBA tool:</p><ul><li><p><em>Restartability</em> means that when this DBA tool is doing its thing (via sometimes long running jobs, as per the nature of the work to be completed), unexpected things may happen (deadlocks, time abends, etc).</p></li><li><p>If any of those things happen, and you don\'t want to restart from your backup (before you started), then the DBA tool expects you to restart from the (check-)point from which things started to go wrong (and from where you want everything to be re-executed).</p></li><li><p>Better still (or should I say \"even worse\"?), if a newbee to the DBA tool doesn\'t real know how to restart from such checkpoint, and simply tries again (from the beginning), then the DBA tool will simply fail with some kind of user error. And this with an indication with something like \"<em>Until you tell me how you want me to proceed after my last point of failure, I refuse to do anything (to not make things even worse)</em>\".</p></li><li>In the end, the real clue to implement this restartability in the SCM tool being used, required the SCM tool to be tuned also. Actually to allow it to be used for <em>restarting failed SCM procedures</em> (typically related to deliveries to target test/prod environments) ... instead of just <em>submitting the failed SCM procedure all over again</em> (which is how typically those SCM tools recover from such situations).</li></ul><p>Bonus: after the SCM integration of the BMC alternative got completed, the customer decided to change their DBA tool to the IBM alternative. And even though both alternatives don\'t really look the same, the impact of it to the SCM integration was rather minimal: simply a matter of replacing (in some reusable SCM customization) some calls to the BMC alternative by the equivalent calls to the IBM alternative ... which (using DevOps terminology) got implemented by <a href=\"/questions/tagged/feature-flags\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged \'feature-flags\'\" rel=\"tag\">feature-flags</a> / <a href=\"/questions/tagged/feature-toggles\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged \'feature-toggles\'\" rel=\"tag\">feature-toggles</a>.</p>',3157,'2020-08-25 23:21:50',0,0,0),(3438,4,3336,'<p>I realise this answer might not be a perfect fit for you, but here\'s what I did</p><p>I was the first developer working at a very busy ecommerce startup, with incredibly high traffic.

The data was then processed into an RDBMS format which cost 6 TB of usable data which accounted for about 10 years of reportable data. The point being that at scale, these kinds of practices simply aren\'t practical. Storage is expensive - probably the greatest compute expense. This provides several interesting challenges:</p><ol><li><strong>Backups</strong> - the innodb plugins are great and all, but the backup times on that much data just aren\'t that practical</li><li><strong>Restore times</strong> - for large datasets - especially if you need replication to catch up after a restore getting back to an operational state can take days or even weeks</li><li><strong>Creating/seeding new instances</strong> - Often the work you may be doing in dev/test involves ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) jobs on your dataset.  These need to be validated using QA testing units, but this needs to be done in a non-destructive manner so that the origional production dataset is preserved. While in a disaster, you may be willing to deal with a long restore time on the understanding that backups are an insurance policy and the intent is to avoid them, the DevOps development workflow requires that, essentially, you be able to perform a restore or copy of your data on a regular basis (perhaps multiple times a day)</li><li><strong>Capacity</strong> - Slinging around that much data at the scale I just described can be very I/O intensive. No only do you need to address the problems described in 1-3, but you need to do it in a way that doesn\'t cause outages or performance slowdowns to your production systems.</li></ol><p>While the above considerations may not be a concern at smaller scales, at larger scales, these become huge problems. This means that it is <strong><em>extremely important</em></strong> that you define your requirements and forecast the size of your dataset.<br><br></p><h2>Defining requirements</h2><hr><p>As a result, you need to define several requirements:</p><ol><li><strong>RTO</strong> - RTO or Restore Time Objective for backups are one of the most important drivers of database backup solutions. While, at first it might not appear relevant to most of the other problems, it becomes extremely relevant when you ask \"What if I used my backup solution for creating or seeding new instances?\". I\'ll cover some techniques for doing so in the next section.</li><li><strong>RPO</strong> - RPO or Restore Point Objective for backups defines A) how far back you are able to restore (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years) B) The backup interval at different tiers and C) how granularly you can restore. For example, for E-mail databases, Message Level Backups - restoring a specific E-mail - are often sought. Similarly, you may find that data over a few days is completely useless - so there is no point restoring back a year.</li><li><strong>Size of your dataset</strong> - This is important because for a 1MB database, your RTO may be achieved with most backup products and solutions. For a 10TB database however, you will find that a full, row level backup to LTO 3 tape <em>probably</em> won\'t achieve your RTO and could interfere with your RPO because backups begin exceeding your backup window. You can\'t exactly just do a mysqldump on this large of a dataset, but could probably get away with that on the 1MB database.</li><li><strong>Database consistency</strong> - A final thing that makes an immense difference in continuous deployment, site reliability, scalability and high-availablity when working with databses is your need (or lack thereof) for consistency. There are three basic types: immediate consistency, Just-In-Time (JIT) consistency and eventual consistency</li></ol><p>In addition to the above major considerations, you also need to consider licensing and support requirements (open source or closed source; in house support, third party support or vendor support) application/language requirements (the connectors for many databases can be important; is your app compiled? Do you have access to the source code? Can you recompile it, or is it provided by a vendor? Or does it run on an interpreted language?) political requirements (Does your organization only trust Oracle? Do they hate oracle? Do they not trust MySql? How do you feel about MariaDB or Postgres?) and database engine (innoDB? MyISAM? Blackhole? NDB Cluster? Spider?) and historical or compatability requirements (we used PL/SQL for years and half our code is built into the oracle engine! How could we ever port over to MariaDB?!?)</p><p>All of these things (significantly) impact the tools available to you.<br><br></p><h2>Some Options for in-house data management</h2><hr><p><em>Note: The following is in no way exhaustive, and other SE users should chime in with additional suggestions.</em></p><p>With the generic considerations out of the way, let me provide you with some techniques and technologies for addressing the above. First, ask yourself if you really <em>need</em> to use an RDBMS or if unstructured data with something like Hadoop, CouchDB or even Object Oriented Storage (something like swift) is an option. </p><p>Second, consider looking into a cloud based solution. This outsources some of this headache and leaves the complicated problems to highly qualified (and paid) individuals. At scale however, you can find this really eats into your budget (cloud providers DO make a profit at this, and at a certain scale, you can just afford to employ these experts yourself,) or if you are working under specific security or political requirements (read: we can\'t do clouds) consider a hybrid NFS/FibreChannel Filer. Most of these filers, such as those by NetApp, Pure Storage and Tegile support a delta based snapshotting and cloning technique that can be very handy for A) taking backups, B) Restoring backups and C) Seeding new backups.</p><p>At this point, I need to note that I am not a backup and storage expert, so there some portions of this problem that I never quite was able to solve before I moved on to other problems (and greener pastures).</p><p><em>But</em> that being said, these products allow you to take differential snapshots underneath your databse. You will need to script out a full \"lock tables with read lock\" on one of your database instances (a read-only slave is recommended) and dump your binlog position or GTID but for these filers, once you do, you will be able to use these snaps to create new instances of your database. You will want to put binlogs on a seperate partition and put only your database data on these partitions. Once you do, you will be able to clone these partitions (on NetApps, this is know as a \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8VI_L5K8VM\" rel=\"noreferrer\">FlexClone</a>\") The only issue with these is that they cannot span datastores which means that all your I/O is still impacting the same datastore/volume and calculating deltas can cause some overhead in terms of CPU resources.</p><p>This is because for each block read the filer must determine if the data resides in the frozen origional snapshot, or in the delta. For volumes/stores with multiple snapshots, this might need to be checked multiple times. You can overcome this by refreshing the data (meaning, discard your snapshot and clone it again periodically - which might happen naturally and organically for a good continuous deployment environment) Or by permanently splitting the volume (known as a \"Flex Split\" in NetApp terminology) which will take a moment to permanently resolve the deltas and create an entirely new and seperate volume.</p><p>These delta clones have the added benefit of reducing your overall storage requirement - you can spawn several clones or instance of your production database data to do your development, testing and validation. If you are only keeping one copy of your large dataset plus the (what are likely to be) small deltas, you reduce your overall storage cost and footprint.</p><p>The only trick here is that this may not constitute a full backup solution as the \"backup\" still resides on your filer. For this you may need to use something NetApp calls a Snap Mirror which will mirror data (using rsync-style technology) between filers and even datacenters, or use some type of integrated backup solution which can backup to tape one of your delta snapshots or a flex-clone.</p><p>This however has one major flaw: All of your data - dev, test and prod is <em>still</em> using I/O on the same filer and storage head. To work around this, consider creating a slave database instance on a second filer which can be the seeding point for you Test and/or dev filer, or consider using a load balancer/applcation delivery controller for your application layer to mirror production requests into your testing (and/or dev) environment(s). This has the added benefit of throwing prodcution traffic at your QA/Test environment before promoting to production for issues that might not be immediately noticed. You can then check your logs for errors based on production traffic and user behavior.</p><p>This then should allow you to use a few script to programatically spawn and destroy entire (and large) datasets for use with continuous deployment methodologies.<br><br> </p><h2>Scalability and High Availability</h2><p>While you asked about continuous deployment, DevOps is conserned with more than <em>just</em> continuous deployment - so I am going to include some bits about redundancy, scalability and high availability. </p><p>I mentioned, JIT, immediate and eventual consistency. This is where varous RDBMS engines come in. Eventual consistency is relatively easy by simply configuring circular asynchronous replication. This can cause some collisions however *(what if your application layer updates data on one side of the cluster and on the other side of the cluster before replication is completed?) For immediate consistency, look at Galera cluster which will force synchronous replication, but causes scalability issues (how will you replicate to your Disaster Recovery site or load balance geographically without incurring significant latency due to propigation delay at the network layer?) You can also see if you can do synchronous replication within the datacenter and asynchronous replication between sites, but this seems the worst of both worlds.</p><p>Typically however, most poeple do not need fully synchronous replication - this is <em>usually</em> only needed for very specific (and exotic) high-write environments where multi-master is needed with table sharding. Most apps can deal with Just-In-Time consistency using a database proxy. For example, <a href=\"http://www.scalearc.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ScaleArc</a> will monitor replication status and track where writes just went (to send subesquent read requests until replication catches up) to provide Just-In-Time consistency and the <em>appearance</em> of database consistency. ScaleArc is compatable with Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle and MSSQL and can use regular expressions to shard/partition your databases for applications that can\'t use shard keys. It also has a robust REST API for your configuration management software to interact with - and their support team is outstanding</p><p>Similarly, you might wish to consider a free alternative, <a href=\"https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-maxscale\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MaxScale</a> developed by the MariaDB team for MariaDB. It lacks the GUI and some of the caching features of ScaleArc however.</p><p>Finally, MySQL fabric (and the in-RAM only MySQL Cluster - if you can afford that much RAM) are other potentials - especially with MySQL\'s new proxy. This can provide the scalability and redundancy component to your environment.</p><p>Postgres and Oracle should have the replication and sharding features you need, but ScaleArc will pair well if you need a proxy.</p><p>Ultimately, all these peices add up to a highly flexible environment suitable for continuous deployment and development if you are unable to simply use a cloud based environment and let your cloud provider deal with the above problems for you.</p>',3204,'2020-08-25 23:21:51',0,0,0),(3448,4,3336,'<p>You shouldn\'t hire a DevOps engineer because DevOps encompasses such a wide variety of disciplines that one individual cannot possibly be an expert in all aspects of these disciplines.

Developers should care about docker as there are other developers who are willing to use docker and have already built an expertise in it. They are willing to take up the roles of a DevOps engineer along with being a developer. So the Ops part of DevOps is what they are now building expertise on. </p><p>These days, you\'ll find more and more guys who can develop, orchestrate, automate tests, automate jobs and build tools to monitor and take this complete package into production single-handedly. These are the guys who are pushing docker and other tools among the developer community. </p><p>Also, the tide of market is towards virtualization, auto-scaling, automation, machine learning and docker fits in all of these. It has become very imperative to use docker. The businesses are willing to pay 2x for a single guy who takes all these responsibilities and when there is demand for such guys, the supply will also begin. This is from point of view of an employee-employer.</p><p>Technically, in the organisations I have worked, there are separate development and DevOps teams, although they work very closely for deliveries.The DevOps engineers and developers share a vast majority of skill-sets here and hence there is a negotiation of duties sometimes. </p><p>The bare minimum a developer can do is to share his binaries, but he needs to understand that the binaries will be used to run inside a docker container and for that he needs to understand how docker works. For kubes, swarms, mesos etc, the developer may not even care what\'s being used, but basics of docker should be very well understood by the developer and a mindset should be there from the beginning to build the application loosely coupled for re-use as micro-services. If the application is built from that mindset (which requires basics of docker), then the DevOps engineers can take it up from there to auto-scale, orchestrate, test, deploy and monitor. </p><p>Also, most of the times there is no one size fits all kind of thing.

Read on for some more details on both ...</p><h1>Get Management Commitment</h1><p>Once that is in place, things become easy for such DevOps engineers. Especially whenever resistance (from all sorts of parties) comes into the game. Trust me, there will be such resistance, which challenges such as:</p><ul><li>Why do we have to change? I want to keep doing what I did for X years already!</li><li>I do not want to loose the (technical) power I have, and complete all sorts of workflow procedures, to get a silly fix in production that should take me like 5 minutes instead of 5 hours (or days ...).</li><li>... (I could add another dozen bullets here ...).</li></ul><p>Whenever those challenges come up, all a DevOps engineer should have to say is like:</p><blockquote>  <p><strong><em>I\'m sorry, I\'m just doing my job ... based on instructions from upper management.</em></strong></p></blockquote><h1>Get Required Budgets</h1><p>An effective way to get Required Budgets, is to create/submit an appropriate business case which explains the tangible and intangible benefits of various DevOps practises by applying them to some real world cases that apply to the company itself. </p><p>Below are some real world cases I experienced myself, as an SCM consultant hired by some companies where these things had happened. I know, SCM is only part of DevOps, but it\'s the area where I have <em>some</em> expertise ...</p><h3>1. Benefits of automation</h3><p>Due to some strike from only 2 (!!!) computer operators (who did not type the console commands anymore that they where expected to type), trains had to be halted somewhere half the way between 2 factories (since the system at the factory where the train was heading to was down, crucial data about handling the train was not available).</p><p>By implementing an SCM system, many operator commands were automated.</p><h3>2. Reduce software license costs</h3><p>Some software vendor had decided to increase some yearly fees for the (outdated) SCM software, which management didn\'t agree to. Therefor they created a special project to get it replaced by some alternative SCM software. </p><p>The budget of the project was equal to the yearly fee they didn\'t want to keep paying. That included flying in engineers from other continents (like me) to make the project succeed.</p><h3>3. Reduce operating costs</h3><p>Some major insurance company was using some FTP software to transfer software fixes to about 13.000 midrange computers (AS/400s) throughout the country, and this whenever \"a\" fix became available. The cost of 1 such transfer was about 4 USD (13.000 x 4 = 52.000 USD for a single transfer ...). The software consisted of 120.000 components, developed/maintained by about 150 developers. Do the math about the probability that 1 developer made 1 (tiny) mistake in any of these 120.000 components, which made it to production, and required an urgent fix, which would cost another 52.000 USD (just for the transfer!).</p><p>By implementing an adequate SCM system (with managed test environments, approvals, etc), this company achieved a major cost reduction. Think about it, if the SCM system could prevent the need for only 20 transfers of urgent fixes, it resulted in a cost reduction of 52.000 x 20 = 1.040.000 USD (quite a budget to implement an SCM system, they only needed a fraction of that amount to get the job done).</p><h3>4. Reduce costs of unavailability</h3><p>If the above cases are not convincing enough, then think of the system(s) of a major credit card company being unavailable around the world. I\'ve been told that 1 second of unavailability costs them 1.000.000 USD.</p><p>That\'s probably also the reason why, for a very long time, such companies have sophisticated DevOps tools in place, for many decades already.

I think there\'s an opportunity there to address the lone wolf syndrome; particularly in a dev environment, infrastructure-as-code provides a great framework for sharing the load.  Ops people should be experts in determining and defining infrastructure needs for application, but they should also be able to build a platform to let dev roles do as much as they can independently.</p><p>It sounds like a silo within a team; old habits die hard.  A coder may not feel comfortable spinning up and hardening a server, but in a pure devops model, they should have the tools to do so.  An ops person in a devops team shouldn\'t responsible for delivering infrastructure for the app itself, but they should provide some insight into what is needed and some guidance on how the app developers can do it themselves.  It\'s almost a meta-infrastructure model; ops engineers build infrastructure that can build infrastructure on demand when requested by the development team.</p><p>Consultation, communication, and blending of responsibilities are all crucial to the success of a devops team.</p>',3227,'2020-08-25 23:21:58',0,0,2),(3502,1,3351,'<p>TL;DR: Since upper management is usually fickle and prone to anger, I\'d suggest trying to bend his mind a bit to get a different perspective, while changing things for the better, gradually.</p><p>(I am assuming that his trouble is mainly with the reluctant <em>devs</em>, not his other <em>ops</em> colleagues who seem to do classical operations mainly.)</p><p>IMO, even if you have DevOps going, that does not necessarily mean that every developer needs to be a full fledged DevOps guru. I find it rather normal that there will be one or two real experts in a given group of people, and the rest more or less tag along.

This, IMO is the main thing that has to stop. One solution for that would be to push very hard for the cattle-not-pet approach, i.e. relentlessly tear down VMs or containers left and right as soon you can, and spin up new ones continuously.</p><p>Second, of course everybody needs to be <em>aware</em> of what the automation is doing, and at least in theory, with some digging around maybe, be able to start the automation machinery (i.e., if everything runs from a commit/push, then the devs need to be aware and very much up to date with the fact that there will be stuff happening in the background when they commit). The CI(/CD) pipeline needs to be quite visible and should be a thing everybody is constantly aware of (i.e. when a dev breaks it).</p><p>Third, the \"one guy\" of course has to watch out that he does not do menial, everyday tasks for his colleagues (e.g., creating Dockerfile after Dockerfile for <em>their</em> artifacts...).</p><p>Fourthly, the solutions the DevOps guy creates of course have to <em>actually be superior</em> to the manual approaches of the past in some measurable way. In that case, it should be possible for him to <em>demonstrate</em> his improvements; i.e., demonstrate how things get easier for everybody, or how it seems to be impossible to introduce bugs in the later stages of the pipe etc. If this does not seem possible, then the DevOps guy needs to take a good long hard look at what he is doing. If it is possible, that calls for brownbag sessions and plenty of evangelisation in his team. </p><p>Obviously, in such a reluctant environment, you will probably not be arriving at a wholly automated CD solution, or at trunk based development anytime soon. But I would not worry too much about being singled out. He is the expert, and if he is doing his job well, the whole team will very gradually improve. </p><p>And finally, if after years and years of toiling there is just no visible improvement with his colleagues, it is always possible to look for other avenues (be it inside or outside the company).

It has become more of a necessity wherein the preferred way would be to automate pieces, if not the entire process. This approach gives the users (developers) flexibility to use a fixed step along with being able to customize as needed.<br/>     The advantage in this approach is that we can automate the parts that we want to while the individual process can be tied together by the developer. The more granularized the automation steps, the better control they have.<br/>     Also, there are many tools for automation in spaces like robotic automation, SOP automation (for servicing industry), report automation (like Splunk), etc.<br/><b>2) <em>DevOps</em>:</b> <br/>     Given the state of delivery quality and timeliness that is being expected out of the current world, there is a necessity to extend automation of the software delivery process. To enable this and provide value to the customer in the fastest way possible, DevOps does extensively rely on automation tools.<br/>     The advantage in this approach is that, the individual steps can be automated to bring about consistency across enterprise while the overall orchestration can be modified to suit the process needed by that project.<br/>     The individual automation tools (in a way) like Chef for deployment, Docker via Dockerfile, Maven for build, etc. can be tied together probably via Jenkins to provide the required solution while at the same time bringing down the time needed for implementation or usage.<br/>Hope this helps to add any value to the thought process that you may already have.<br><br/><strong>Edit:</strong> Forgot to add that I had talked about the Process and Tools - 2 of the 3 aspects in DevOps.

Postmortems are essential and meant to discover the root cause of problems.  I have been involved in many postmortems where someone was named and it turned out that that named person was not the culprit and talking to the named person was critical to discover the real cause of the problem.  Without the name of the person, this would not have been possible.  So you have to use names.</p><p>As long as humans are involved in any process, mistakes will be made.

This type of non discussion of names can cause \"whisper campaign\" effect when the person is not around and can cause unneeded gossip and will poison the environment.</p><p>If management requires no names on the postmortem, names will still be used in discussion to verify facts and follow ups.</p><p>An example of keeping it fun for everyone: At a past company, in a .com era start up, we had a lively group of coders(~15), devops(~10) and 20 others in a large open office environment and everyone shared a similar sense of humor.  We had an orange traffic cone that the developers referred to as the \"cone of shame\".  </p><p>If someone did not merge correctly, or their changes broke the build or regression testing wasn\'t all green, the build master would make a judgement on the spot and leave the cone of shame on the monitor of the offender.  A cone on top of the monitor was visible to everyone as you walked into the office.</p><p>We would all come in the next day and see the cone of shame and share a laugh.  Often times the build master had chosen the wrong person and the break was caused by another person and the cone was passed around.  It was proudly wore on your head and seen in a casual office water cooler discussion that day.  It got the team talking, interacting and laughing which is all good for team chemistry.</p><p>You have to keep it open and part of that is not scared of using names and really knowing your team and keeping a fun culture.</p>',3223,'2020-08-25 23:22:06',0,0,0),(3570,1,3361,'<p>Professionals are responsible.

You will likely want to do several of the following:</p><hr><p>First, optimize your image layers for reuse. Put frequently changing steps later in the Dockerfile to increase the chances that early layers are cached from previous builds. A reused layer will show up as more disk space in a <code>docker image ls</code>, but if you examine the underlying filesystem, only one copy of each layer is ever stored on disk. That means 3 images of 2 GB each, but which only have 50 MB different in the last few layers the build, will only take up 2.1 GB of disk space, even though the listing makes it appear that they are using 6 GB since you are double counting each of the reused layers.</p><p>Layer reuse is why you see images with infrequently changing build dependencies install those first before copying in code. See any python example that has a pattern like:</p><pre><code>FROM pythonWORKDIR /appCOPY requirements.txt .RUN pip install -r requirements.txt# note how the code is copied only after the pip install# since code changes but requirements.txt doesn\'tCOPY . .CMD [\"gunicorn\", \"app:app\"]</code></pre><hr><p>Pick a minimal base image. This is why you see people go from <code>ubuntu</code> to <code>debian:slim</code> (the slim variants are smaller, shipping with fewer tools), or even <code>alpine</code>. This reduces the size of your starting point, and is very helpful if you are constantly pulling new versions of the base image. However, if your base image rarely changes, layer reuse removes much of the advantage of a minimal base image.</p><p>The smallest base image you can pick is <code>scratch</code>, which is nothing, no shell or libraries, and is only useful with statically compiled binaries. Otherwise, pick a base image that includes the tools you need without lots of tools you don\'t need.</p><hr><p>Next, any step that changes or deletes a file should be combined with previous steps that create that file. Otherwise the layered filesystem, which uses copy-on-write even on things like a file permission change, will have the original file in a previous layer and the image size will not shrink when you remove files. This is why your <code>rm</code> commands have no effect on resulting disk space. Instead, you can chain the commands, like:</p><pre><code>RUN apt-get update \\ && apt-get install -y \\      a-package \\      wget \\ && ... \\ && apt-get purge -y wget \\ && rm -r a-build-dir \\ && apt-get purge -y a-package</code></pre><p>Note that overuse of command chaining can slow down your builds since you need to reinstall the same toolset any time a prerequisite changes (e.g. the code being pulled with wget). See multi-stage below for a better alternative.</p><hr><p>Any file you create that you do not need in your resulting image should be deleted, in the step that creates it. This includes package caches, logs, man pages, etc. To discover what files are being created in each layer, you can use a tool like wagoodman/dive (which I have not personally vetted and would express caution since it runs with full root access on your host), or you can build your docker images without pruning the intermediate containers and then view the diff with:</p><pre><code># first create and leave containers from any RUN step using options on builddocker image build --rm=false --no-cache -t image_name . # review which layers use an unexpectedly large amount of spacedocker image history image_name# list all containers, particularly the exited ones from abovedocker container ps -a # examine any of those containersdocker container diff ${container_id} # ... repeat the diff for other build steps# then cleanup exited containersdocker container prune</code></pre><p>With each of those intermediate containers, the diff will show what files are added, changed, or deleted in that step (these are indicated with an <code>A</code>, <code>C</code>, or <code>D</code> before each filename). What diff is showing is the container specific read/write filesystem, which is any file changed by the container from the image state using copy-on-write.</p><hr><p>The best way to reduce image size is eliminating any unneeded components, like compilers, from your shipped image. For that, multi-stage builds let you compile in one stage, and then copy only the resulting artifacts from the build stage to a runtime image that has only the minimum needed to run the application. This avoids the need to optimize any of the build steps since they are not shipped with the resulting image.</p><pre><code>FROM debian:9 as build# still chain update with install to prevent stale cache issuesRUN apt-get update \\ && apt-get install -y \\      a-package \\      wget \\RUN ... # perform any download/compile stepsFROM debian:9-slim as releaseCOPY --from=build /usr/local/bin/app /usr/local/bin/appCMD [ \"/usr/local/bin/app\" ]</code></pre><p>Multi-stage is ideal with statically compiled binaries which you can run with scratch as your base image, or transitioning from a compile environment like JDK to a runtime like JRE. This is the easiest way to dramatically reduce your image size while still having fast builds. You may still perform chaining of steps in your release stage if you have steps that change or delete files created in previous steps, but for the most part, the <code>COPY</code> from another stage isolates the release stage from any layer bloat experienced in the earlier build stages.</p><hr><p>Note, I do not recommend squashing images since this reduces the size of one image at the expense of eliminating layer reuse. That means future builds of the same image will require more disk and network traffic to send updates. To go back to the first example, squashing may reduce your image from 2 GB to 1 GB, but not 3 images may take up 3 GB instead of the 2.1 GB.</p>',3255,'2020-08-25 23:22:09',0,0,0),(3596,1,3347,'<p>One could use <a href=\"https://github.com/030/a2d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A2D</a> to bake an app into a docker image while taking certain things into account, e.g. non-root, permissions, location of the app:</p><blockquote><pre><code>docker run -v $PWD:/projectName utrecht/a2d:1.0.0 \\       -projectName someProjectName -dockerfile /projectName/Dockerfile</code></pre></blockquote><p>returns:</p><blockquote><pre><code>FROM golang:1.12.4-alpine as builderCOPY . ./someProjectName/WORKDIR someProjectNameRUN adduser -D -g \'\' someProjectName && \\    apk add git && \\    CGO_ENABLED=0 go build && \\    cp someProjectName /someProjectName && \\    chmod 100 /someProjectNameFROM scratchCOPY --from=builder /etc/group /etc/groupCOPY --from=builder /etc/passwd /etc/passwdCOPY --from=builder --chown=someProjectName:someProjectName /someProjectName /usr/local/someProjectNameCOPY --from=builder /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/USER someProjectNameENTRYPOINT [\"/usr/local/someProjectName\"]</code></pre></blockquote>',3169,'2020-08-25 23:22:10',0,0,0),(3598,1,3355,'<p>The way you install certbot plugins depends on how you installed certbot itself.

This wrapper creates a private Python virtual installation (generally in <code>/opt/eff.org/certbot/venv</code>), and install certbot into that directory. A nice feature of certbot-auto is that it automatically keeps the certbot client up-to-date. A major downside is that it does not <em>officially</em> supports plugins installation (that is, aside from four plugins that are installed by default).</p><p>It is easy enough to work around this limitation, as described in <a href=\"https://devops.stackexchange.com/a/4845\">Ryan G\'s solution</a>. However, plugins installed through that procedure will be lost every time certbot-auto updates itself, which can result in random renew failures.

When you are using old monolithic applications then VMs are not a bad option. So it always depends on the context what you need to learn specifically.The topic is rather broad to summarize it.

If I implement a solution then this means that it is completely automated and that a colleague can deploy machines themselves rather than asking me. Sometimes it is not immediately possible to automate it completely, but then I ensure that it is automated for myself to ensure that I only have to run one command in order to get the work done (LowOps), instead of wasting a couple of hours. If I have created such solution, I ensure that a ticket has been created for a colleague to automate my personal solution for everybody. Example: a collegue of mine transformed one of my bash script in a bot that it now run every night. This means that the knowledge has been transferred and that a NoOps solution has been created and we can both focus on new tasks. </p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T7Xsf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T7Xsf.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p><p>Figure 1: <a href=\"https://www.gslab.com/blog-post/what-is-noops/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.gslab.com/blog-post/what-is-noops/</a></p><blockquote>  <p>\"how to start with devops\"</p></blockquote><p>Ensure that you are part of a team with mixed competences and that the team has to deploy the software themselves.

By that, I have <a href=\"http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this quote from Werner Vogels</a> in mind:</p><blockquote>  <p>Giving developers operational responsibilities has greatly enhanced  the quality of the services, both from a customer and a technology  point of view. The traditional model is that you take your software to  the wall that separates development and operations, and throw it over  and then forget about it. Not at Amazon. You build it, you run it.  This brings developers into contact with the day-to-day operation of  their software. It also brings them into day-to-day contact with the  customer. This customer feedback loop is essential for improving the  quality of the service.</p></blockquote><p>I\'m specifically thinking of a set of developers that:</p><ul><li>Were hired into a developer role, with little/no mention of ops-related tasks.</li><li>Traditionally have \"thrown code over the wall\" to an ops team.</li><li>Traditionally have a 9-5 work schedule, and are actively hostile to the idea of \"pager duty\", participating in disaster recovery, writing post-mortems, etc, <em>especially</em> outside of normal business hours. (Note: I only have very infrequent outages in mind for this; I am not proposing that we add after-hours customer support to this team\'s workload.)</li><li>Are not currently responsible for writing/supporting monitoring or alerting on their applications.</li></ul><p>Suppose there is a team that is rapidly developing new cloud micro-services with a profile that is getting to be such that handing these services off to an ops team is sub-optimal because they can\'t keep up in regards to gaining deep knowledge of the services that is required to effectively manage and monitor them.  \"You build it, you run it\" would work better for this team because tasks could delegated to each responsible team member. So this team would begin taking part in designing infrastructure, monitoring/alerting tools for the services, and (very infrequently) responding to outage events.</p><p>I am specifically interested in methodologies, backed up by real world examples.
